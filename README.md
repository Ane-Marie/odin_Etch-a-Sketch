# Etch A Sketch

A simple browser-based drawing app inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) curriculum.

## Features

- Adjustable grid size
- Hover to draw
- Rainbow mode option
- "Reset" button

## How to use

Go to [Live Demo](https://ane-marie.github.io/odin_Etch-a-Sketch/) and have fun!

## Prerequisites

- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs
- Create the divs using JavaScript
- Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid
- Set up a "hover" effect so that the divs change color when your mouse passes over them
- Option for user to set the number of squares per side. Once entered the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.

  EXTRA:

- Rather than the squares being the same color randomise the squares' RGB values
- Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%

## Project Goals

This project was built to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic CSS styling. It helped solidify understanding of JavaScript fundamentals like loops, functions and user input.
